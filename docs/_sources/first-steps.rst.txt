First Steps
===========

After cloning the repository (see the GitHub instructions on repository
home page) and entering the repository folder you should install the
package requirements using

::

    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

(You may need to omit the ``sudo`` if you are in a virtual environment.)

Provided that ``sys.path`` contains the absolute path to the repository
folder you can now import the package or its components in the normal
way.
